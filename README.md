# Welcome to my QHacks 2025 Submission - SmartKingston ðŸ‘‹

Hello, this is my submission for QHacks 2025. I apologize for the awful organization, and sloppy code.
I slept for about 35 minutes during this whole event, and as it progressed, my organization got worse and I had to rely on last minute fixes to make it somewhat bearable. I hope you enjoy my submission, I had a great time this weekend, the staff were amazing and the events were defenitely worth my time. See you next year!

Remark: Yes, I realize my API keys are public here, the expo-dotenv library was giving me so many issues for no reason, so after January 29th at 12:00am, they will be deleted :)


This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
