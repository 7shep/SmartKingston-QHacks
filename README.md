# Welcome to my QHacks 2025 Submission - SmartKingston ðŸ‘‹

Hello, this is my submission for QHacks 2025. I apologize for the awful organization
I slept for about 35 minutes during this whole event, and as it progressed, my organization got worse and I had to rely on last minute fixes to make it somewhat bearable. I hope you enjoy my submission, I had a great time this weekend, the staff were amazing and the events were defenitely worth my time. See you next year!
